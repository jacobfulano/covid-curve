## Goal
Coronavirus cases have been increasing exponentially in the US. In order to get a better understanding of this awful phenomenon, we have decided to post a daily plot of cumulative confirmed cases.

While there are many metrics

## Data
Confirmed case data is curated by a team at Johns Hopkins University here: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases

The data can be fit with an exponential curve to estimate future cumulative cases:
